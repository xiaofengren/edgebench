#### What is EdgeBench?
EdgeBench is an open-source benchmark suite for serverless edge computing platforms. EdgeBench features three key applications: 

- A speech/audio-to-text decoder (uses [pocketsphinx-python](https://github.com/bambocher/pocketsphinx-python))
- An image recognition machine learning model (used [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) internally)
- A scalar value generator emulating a temperature -humidity sensor

Each application processes a bank of input data on an edge device and sends results to cloud storage. We target EdgeBench for two of the most popular edge computing platforms currently available, [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/) and [Microsoft Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/) , to compare not only the edge platforms to each other but also to the providers’ respective cloud-only alternatives, EdgeBench also provides cloud-based workload implementations.
